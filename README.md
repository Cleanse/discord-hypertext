# discord-hypertext
An unofficial PHP API wrapper for the Discord client (http://discordapp.com).  
 
**We're currently on version 1.2. This version has some major changes that could break your old code.**

Changes:  
 * Added a new token option for authenticating.  
 * The login route is rate limited, so please cache the token for login. `$discord->token()`  
 * [Mentions][mentions] are now auto created if you use `<@userid>`
